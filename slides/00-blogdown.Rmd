+ Hugo calls these "sections"
+ Every section has a "page" (usually singular)

# This is the home folder

In the academic theme, these are *widgets*:

+ Portable! Move the `widget.md` file to any other [page](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-widget-page)
+ Configurable! Think: Mr. Potato Head

# Edit your home page

Pick your widgets- I suggest leaving them all in place but setting `active = FALSE` to remove any.


If you delete, they are always in: `themes/hugo-academic/exampleSite/content/home`

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, play_sound = TRUE)
```


Bonus: move a widget to another [page](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-widget-page). You could, for example, have the `about.md` widget be the **only** active widget on the home page.

# Go Deeper

Read more of the [docs](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/#personalizing-widgets) for personalizing widgets.

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Quiz! `r emo::ji("sparkles")`

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2, play_sound = TRUE)
```

What happens if you edit `public/` directly, or delete the folder altogether, then serve the site again? 


Hint: try it! `r emo::ji("fire")`

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Trick question `r emo::ji("sparkles")`

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 15, play_sound = TRUE)
```

Should you ever edit files in the `public/` directory?
