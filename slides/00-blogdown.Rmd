# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Ready, Set, Goal `r emo::ji("sparkles")`

## Users already have an existing repo on GitHub and want to add a .Rmd hosted Hugo themed website to the directory 


---
class: inverse
# Step 1 

- Fork `https://github.com/hidyverse/RMD4HS`

- Clone with RStudio `New Project` from version control 

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-cycle.png")
```

---
class: inverse
# Step 2 

Create directories within project root 

```{r eval=F}
dir.create("website")
dir.create("docs")
```

---
class: inverse
# Step 3

Create `.noyekyll` file within the new `docs/` directory


```{r eval = F}
file.create('docs/.nojekyll')
```


This will stop GitHub from being confused later that we're using Hugo (GitHub typically expects Jekyll)

```{r eval=F}
ls -a doc/
```

**HINT**: Use above to double check your `.nojekyll` file was made or turn on `show hidden files` within `more` in the `files` browser in RStudio  

---
class: inverse, middle
# Step 4

Prep GitHub repo for Pages documents 

- Go to `Settings` in your github repo 
- Select `Pages` on the guide on the left of the screen
- Change `Branch` from none to `main` (or `master`) 
- Change repo from root to `docs/`
- Save & Refresh
- Copy the url made for your repo
Optional: Return to your main repo page and add the new url to the `about` section at the right to make your life easier later

---
class: inverse
# Step 5

Navigate into the `website/` directory

```{r eval=F}
setwd("website/")
```

We will be copying the `website/public/` to `docs/` and pushing `docs/` to GitHub when we're ready.  

---
class: inverse
# Step 6

Create a blogdown website! 

```{r eval =F}
install.packages("blogdown")
blogdown::new_site()
```

**HINT**: Cloud users need to say no to rendering the site and add 
```{r eval = F}
relativeURLs: true
```
to their `config` file prior to viewing a rendered site (**and use the `serve_site()` addin**)! 

---

## This is a Hugo site

```{r out.width="90%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/folder-structure.png")
```


---
class: inverse
# Step 7

Change base url in `config.yaml` to new github pages url 

Paste the url in `config.yaml` as the key to the `baseurl` value

---
class: inverse
# Step 8

Add `website/` to `.gitignore` 

Create (or add to an existing `.gitignore`) in the root project. Include all the website materials in the `.gitignore` for now. We don't need to have our website creation materials be public, just the final posts.

---
class: inverse
# Step 9

prior to pushing to GitHub you'll need to build your site
```{r eval= F}
`blogdown::build_site()`
```


Building the site will fill out the `public/` directory with files from your content within `website/` which we want to copy to `root_project/docs/` to push to GitHub.

# Step 10

Copy contents of new `public/` folder to `../docs/` 

This is a manual process so I doubt this is the most efficient way, but this works! 


```{bash eval=F}
cp -r website/public/* docs/
```
**NOTE**: I used the terminal for this! 

---
class: inverse
# Step 11

Push to existing GitHub repo (or some other upload)

Does `docs/` show up in your changes? 

**HINT**: If you're on the cloud, you need to first tell Git who you are! Try:
```{bash eval=F}
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "UserName"
```
**NOTE**: I used the terminal for this!

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Quiz! `r emo::ji("sparkles")`

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2, play_sound = TRUE)
```

What happens if you edit `public/` directly, or delete the folder altogether, then serve the site again? 


Hint: try it! `r emo::ji("fire")`

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Trick question `r emo::ji("sparkles")`

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 15, play_sound = TRUE)
```

Should you ever edit files in the `public/` directory?
