start with downloading the whole repo with the green `code` button (even if you're using RStudio Cloud, also download the repo locally so you can get a copy of the slides - you will not need RStudio locally to view the slide deck) 

we'll use the `example/` directory during the workshop

navitgate to the `slides/` directory from your file explorer (likely in `Downloads`) and open `00-rmd.html` to view the slies
